      "content": "♥︎Gluten Free Bread Recipe♥︎

Ingredients:
➔1 ⅝ cups (227 g) all purpose gluten free flour blend
➔1 ⅝ teaspoons xanthan gum, omit if your blend already contains it
➔⅜ cup (54 g) tapioca starch/flour
➔2 teaspoons (8 g) granulated sugar
➔2 teaspoons (6 g) instant yeast
➔¼ teaspoon baking soda
➔1 teaspoon (6 g) kosher salt
➔1 cup (8 fluid ounces) warm milk, (about 95°F)
➔1 (50 g (weighed out of shell)) egg, at room temperature, beaten
➔1 tablespoon (14 g) extra virgin olive oil

Instructions:
➔Grease a 1 or 1 1/2 quart glass oven safe bowl and set it aside. If you don’t have a glass bowl, you can use a small round pan or cast iron skillet with high sides. If using an aluminum pan that isn’t dark in color, raise the oven temperature to 400°F (as written and described below, the oven temperature is 375°F).
➔In a large bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum, tapioca starch/flour, sugar, and yeast, and baking soda, and whisk to combine well. Add the salt, and whisk again to combine well.
➔Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the milk, egg, and oil, and mix vigorously. The bread dough/batter should come together and lighten a bit in color as you mix.
➔Transfer the dough/batter to the prepared baking bowl, skillet, or pan, and smooth the top with clean, wet hands or a moistened spatula. Do not compress the dough at all.
➔If you aren't using a bowl or pan with high sides, using a light touch and wet or oiled fingers, try to shape the dough so that it's about as tall as it is wide, to mimic the shape in the photos of the dough in the bowl. Your dough will definitely spread more during baking, though, and may take less time to bake.
➔Cover the dough completely with an oiled piece of plastic wrap. Be careful not to compress the dough, but cover the bowl securely.
➔Place it in a warm, moist place to rise for about 45 minutes, or until the dough has increased to about 150% of its original size. In cool, dry weather, the dough may take longer to rise; in warm, moist weather, it may take less time to rise.
➔When the dough is nearing the end of its rise, preheat your oven to 375°F.
➔After the dough has risen, remove the plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the center of the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the bread is lightly golden brown all around.
➔Remove the bread from the oven and rotate the loaf in the bowl, so it’s upside down. Return the bread to the oven and bake until the crust has darkened slightly all around, and the bread sounds hollow when thumped anywhere, on the bottom or top, about another 15 minutes.
➔The internal temperature of the bread should reach about 195°F on an instant-read thermometer.
➔Turn the bread out onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing and serving.",

Ingredients:
➔1 ¼ cups Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 Baking Flour
➔¼ cup flaxseed meal
➔¼ teaspoon baking soda
➔¼ teaspoon cream of tartar
➔1½ teaspoon baking powder
➔¼ teaspoon salt
➔⅔ cup sugar
➔8 tablespoon unsalted butter melted and cooled
➔1 teaspoon vanilla
➔2 eggs whites separated
➔1 cup milk I used coconut milk
For icing:
➔1 ½ cup powdered sugar
➔1-2 tablespoon milk

Instructions:
➔Preheat oven to 350º.
➔Spray your donut pan with cooking spray.
➔In a large bowl, whisk together the first seven dry ingredients, flour through sugar.
➔In another small bowl whisk together the melted and cooled butter, vanilla, egg yolks, and milk. Make a well in the center of dry ingredients and pour in. Mix gently.
➔In a separate small bowl whisk the two egg whites for about a minute or two with a fork. You are just trying to get them a bit thicker so they add some fluffiness to the doughnuts.
➔Add egg whites to mixture and stir just until mixed.
➔Transfer mixture to a Ziploc bag and cut the corner tip off. This makes it easy to pipe into the donut pan.
➔Fill each well ¾ full without covering the middle section. If you do, your doughnuts won't have a hole.
➔Cook for about 8-10 minutes.
➔Allow to cool completely before glazing.
➔For the icing simply mix the powdered sugar with the desired amount of milk. More milk will make icing runny so don't add too much at one time.
➔Dip doughnuts in icing and place on a rack to drip dry.
➔These can also be made in a mini donut maker.",

Ingredients:
For the Concentrated Strawberry Purée
➔2 cups 300 g fresh strawberries, halved
➔1 Tablespoon 15 g granulated sugar
➔1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
➔pinch of fine sea salt
For the Cake
➔2 cups gluten free flour blend see notes
➔1/2 cup 70 g cornstarch
➔3/4 teaspoon 2 g xanthan gum
➔1 teaspoon 5 g fine sea salt
➔1 1/2 teaspoons 7 g aluminum-free baking powder
➔1/4 teaspoon baking soda
➔2 cups 400 g granulated sugar
➔4 large eggs separated
➔1 cup buttermilk room temperature
➔1/2 cup 4 oz. unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temperature
➔1/3 cup avocado oil see notes
➔2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
➔1/2 cup concentrated strawberry purée
➔3 drops red food coloring optional
➔1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
For the Frosting
➔1 recipe Strawberry Cream Cheese Frosting

Instructions:
➔To make the concentrated strawberry purée, add the strawberries, 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt to a blender canister or food processor. Blend until completely smooth.
➔Add the purée to a small saucepan. Simmer on medium low heat until the purée is reduced by half, stirring occasionally. It'll take about 20-30 minutes to reduce. Cool to room temperature before making the cake.
➔Preheat oven to 350 degrees and spray 3 8-inch round cake pans with non-stick spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten free flour, cornstarch, xanthan gum, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and granulated sugar. Set aside.
➔In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, buttermilk, melted butter, oil, vanilla extract, concentrated strawberry purée, and food coloring (if using). Set aside.
➔Add the egg whites and cream of tartar to a separate, clean medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium-low speed until the egg whites hold a stiff peak. Then set the the egg whites aside.
➔Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just incorporated. Add half of the whipped egg whites to the batter and gently fold in with a spoon. When it's mostly folded in, add the remaining egg whites. Gently fold in until no white streaks remain. ➔Make sure you're folding and not stirring/mixing so you don't deflate the egg whites. It may take a minute or two to fully incorporate.
➔Transfer the batter to the prepared pans, making sure it's distributed evenly and spread the batter in the pans. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-24 minutes.
➔Cool the cakes in the pan for 25 minutes then remove them from the pans and cool completely on wire racks. Once the cakes are cooled, frost them with the strawberry cream cheese frosting.",
